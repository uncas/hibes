Random number
-------------
1) How to generate a random number that is normal distributed?

2) How to generate a random number between y0-dy and y0+dy 
that has highest probability to be close to y0?

Possible solution:
a) Generate a random number x with even chances between -1 and +1.
b) Calculate the number y = f(x) = y0 + dy * x^(2n+1)
    where n=1,2,...
Background:
For the random number x we have the even probability distribution like:
    1 = integral_{-1}^{+1} dx P(x), where P(x) = ½
For the number y the corresponding distribution will be:
    1 = integral_{y0-dy}^{y0+dy} dy Q(y)
Using the relation between x and y we get that
    Q(y) = [dy/(y-y0)]^[2n/(2n+1)] / [2(2n+1)dy]
Alternative formulation:
a) Generate a random number z with even chances between 0 and 1:
b) Calculate the number y = g(z) = y0 + dy * (2z-1)^(2n+1)

Solution from wikipedia:
a) Generate two uniformly distributed random numbers U and V between 0 and 1:
b) Calculate a normally distributed random number by
    X = sqrt(-2 ln U) cos(2 pi V)
or
    Y = sqrt(-2 ln U) sin(2 pi V)


Rejected / waiting
------------------
- Project version
- Issue: Field that tells if the estimate is complete.
- Time units?
- Import data from csv file
- On history page:
    - Speed average + standard deviation
    - List of recent closed tasks that are the basis for the average speeds.
- When task is closed: require elapsed = current estimate
- When issue is closed: require all tasks closed
- Task list: +- buttons to move up/down in sequence
- On estimate page:
    Include progress percentage
        50% ship date per priority (5, 10, 15, ...)
        Evolution of 5%/50%/95% ship date distribution over time
